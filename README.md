# Colloquial.Studio V2

A work in progress.

### Current Errors

-- Sub messages have errors with the ID
-- Fine tune the sliders for range inputs
-- Preload pronouns?

### To Do

. Send dashboard to Fox + UI people

. Testing
-- Test Timeout
-- Test Block

. Potential other
-- Custom CSS
-- Tried pushing this to svelte Head and it doesn't work. Solution is probably to make a CSS parser? Slow but would only need to run on load.
-- Choose how bit and sub messages appear
-- Show Cheers
-- Show number after Emote (doublecheck this I thought it did)
-- Custom css background colour / image;

Changelog
-- Emote Only gets bigger images.
-- Preview style changes as you make them
-- Save styles to the site
-- Load styles from existing URLs
-- Custom animation easing
-- Choose animation time
-- More control over colours
-- Additional styling to pronouns.
