Hmm

Okay so we need to make this work

What I think is maybe we have three variables saved then

SavedSettings - SS
CurrentSettings - CS
ProposedSettings - PS

## Changing Input;

Each change to an input changes the ProposedSettings - Calculate;
Once this is calculated it gets pushed to the CurrentSettings;

## Loading URL

Loading your settings pulls from a URL and sends it to ProposedSettings - Calculate;

## Loading Save

If SavedSettings are detected send them to ProposedSettings - Calculate;

## If CurrentSettings changes

Send those changes to the inputs

. Settings
-- Add style loading
-- Add style saving
